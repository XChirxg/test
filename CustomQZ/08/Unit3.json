"question": "A firm under perfect competition is in short-run equilibrium, earning supernormal profits. At its output level:",
"options": {
"A": "MC is at its minimum point",
"B": "AC is at its minimum point",
"C": "Both MC and AC are at their minimum",
"D": "MC equals market price, exceeding AC" 
},
"correctOption": "D",
"explanation": "In perfect competition, short-run supernormal profits occur when price (set by the market) is above average cost. The firm produces where MC = Price for profit maximization.",

},
{
"question": "A monopolist's demand curve slopes downward because:",
"options": {
"A": "It can set any price it desires",
"B": "It faces no competition", 
"C": "To sell more, it must lower price", 
"D": "Demand for its product is perfectly elastic"
},
"correctOption": "C",
"explanation": "A monopolist, unlike perfect competition, has market power.  To increase sales volume, it must reduce the price, leading to the downward slope.",

},
{
"question": "Which pricing strategy aims to capture high initial profits, targeting early adopters willing to pay more?",
"options": {
"A": "Penetration Pricing",
"B": "Cost-Plus Pricing", 
"C": "Skimming Pricing",
"D": "Competitive Pricing"
},
"correctOption": "C",

},
{
"question": "If a 10% price increase leads to a 20% decrease in quantity demanded, demand is:",
"options": {
"A": "Inelastic",
"B": "Elastic",
"C": "Unitary Elastic", 
"D": "Perfectly Inelastic"
},
"correctOption": "B",

},
{
"question": "Price discrimination is possible when:", 
"options": {
"A": "The firm has no control over price",
"B": "Markets can be segmented with different price sensitivities", 
"C": "The product is homogeneous", 
"D": "All buyers have equal willingness to pay"
},
"correctOption": "B",
"explanation": "Price discrimination works by charging different prices to groups with varying price elasticity of demand, requiring market segmentation.",

"question": "If the price elasticity of demand is 0.5, a 10% price increase will lead to:",
"options": {
"A": "A 5% decrease in quantity demanded",
"B": "A 20% decrease in quantity demanded", 
"C": "No change in quantity demanded",
"D": "A 5% increase in quantity demanded" 
},
"correctOption": "A",
"explanation": "Quantity change = Elasticity * Price change. Thus, 0.5 * 10% = 5% decrease.",

"options": {
"A": "Downward sloping",
"B": "Horizontal",
"C": "Upward sloping", 
"D": "U-shaped"
},
"correctOption": "B",

"question": "Which is NOT a characteristic of monopolistic competition?",
"options": {
"A": "Many sellers",
"B": "Differentiated products", 
"C": "Easy entry and exit", 
"D": "Homogeneous product" 
},
"correctOption": "D",

"category": "Market Structures" 
},
{
"question": "The demand curve facing an individual firm under perfect competition is:",
"options": {
"A": "Downward sloping but less steep than the market demand curve", 
"B": "Perfectly elastic", 
"C": "Downward sloping and identical to the market demand curve",
"D": "Upward sloping" 
},
"correctOption": "B",
"explanation": "The firm is a price taker. It can sell any quantity at the market price, but raising its price means losing all customers, hence perfectly elastic.",

},
{
"question": "If a firm's average cost is decreasing as it increases output, then:",
"options": {
"A": "It is experiencing diseconomies of scale", 
"B": "Marginal cost is below average cost",
"C": "Marginal cost is above average cost", 
"D": "It is operating in the long run" 
},
"correctOption": "B",
"explanation": "When MC is below AC, it pulls AC down. This is typical in the early stages of production before diminishing returns set in.",
"category": "Cost Concepts"
},
{
"question": "A firm's total revenue is maximized when its price elasticity of demand is:",
"options": {
"A": "Zero",
"B": "Less than one (inelastic)", 
"C": "One (unitary elastic)", 
"D": "Greater than one (elastic)"
},
"correctOption": "C",

"options": {
"A": "Government regulations", 
"B": "Control of key resources", 
"C": "Perfect information",
"D": "Economies of scale" 
},
"correctOption": "C",
"explanation": "Barriers to entry protect monopolies. Perfect information would actually make entry easier, hindering monopoly power.",

},
{
"question": "If the marginal cost of production is rising, then:",
"options": {
"A": "Average variable cost must be rising",
"B": "Average total cost must be rising", 
"C": "Marginal product of labor is falling", 
"D": "The firm is experiencing economies of scale" 
},
"correctOption": "C",
"explanation": "Rising MC is often due to diminishing returns, meaning each additional unit of input (like labor) adds less output, hence falling marginal product.",
"category": "Cost & Production Concepts" 
},
{
"question": "A firm operating under perfect competition will shut down in the short run if:",
"options": {
"A": "Price is less than average total cost",
"B": "Price is less than average variable cost", 
"C": "Economic profit is zero", 
"D": "Total revenue is less than total fixed cost" 
},
"correctOption": "B",
"explanation": "If price can't even cover variable costs, it's better to shut down and minimize losses to just fixed costs in the short run.",

},
{
"question": "A Giffen good is one for which:", 
"options": {
"A": "Demand increases as price increases", 
"B": "Demand is perfectly elastic", 
"C": "Income elasticity of demand is negative",

{
"question": "Which cost concept is relevant for deciding how much output to produce in the short run?",
"options": {
"A": "Fixed cost",
"B": "Sunk cost", 
"C": "Marginal cost",
"D": "Average total cost" 
},
"correctOption": "C",
"explanation": "MC tells the cost of producing ONE more unit. Firms compare this to price/revenue to decide if producing more is profitable.",

{
"question": "In a perfectly competitive market, the market price is determined by:", 
"options": {
"A": "The largest firm in the market",
"B": "Government regulation", 
"C": "The interaction of market demand and supply", 
"D": "Collusion among firms" 
},
"correctOption": "C",
"explanation": "Perfect competition assumes many buyers and sellers, none powerful enough to influence price individually. Price emerges from their combined actions.",
"category": "Market Structures & Price Determination" 
},
{
"question": "A firm's average fixed cost curve:",
"options": {
"A": "Is U-shaped", 
"B": "Slopes upward", 
"C": "Is horizontal", 
"D": "Slopes downward"
},
"correctOption": "D",
"explanation": "Fixed costs don't change with output. As output increases, AFC (Fixed Cost / Output) keeps decreasing, giving the downward slope.",

"options": {
"A": "Interdependence of firms", 
"B": "Significant barriers to entry", 
"C": "Large number of small firms", 
"D": "Strategic behavior" 
},
"correctOption": "C",
"explanation": "Oligopolies have few, large firms, leading to their actions impacting each other significantly. Many small firms would be monopolistic competition.",

"options": {
"A": "Profit maximization", 
"B": "Normal profits", 
"C": "Allocative efficiency", 
"D": "Minimization of average cost"
},
"correctOption": "C",
"explanation": "Allocative efficiency is where societal welfare is maximized, occurring when price (what consumers are willing to pay) matches the cost of production (MC).",
"category": "Efficiency & Pricing"
},
{
"question": "Which is NOT a factor affecting price elasticity of demand?", 
"options": {
"A": "Availability of substitutes", 
"B": "Proportion of income spent on the good",
"C": "Number of firms in the market", 
"D": "Time period considered"
},
"correctOption": "C",
"explanation": "While the market structure impacts a *firm's* elasticity, the *demand* elasticity itself is about consumer behavior, unrelated to firm count.",

{
"question": "If a firm's total cost is Rs. 10,000 and its total variable cost is Rs. 6,000, its total fixed cost is:", 
"options": {
"A": "Rs. 4,000", 
"B": "Rs. 16,000", 
"C": "Rs. 6,000", 
"D": "Cannot be determined" 
},
"correctOption": "A",

"options": {
"A": "Horizontal",
"B": "Vertical",
"C": "Downward sloping",
"D": "Upward sloping"

"options": {
"A": "Free entry and exit of firms",
"B": "Product differentiation",
"C": "Large number of buyers and sellers", 
"D": "Perfect mobility of factors of production" 
},
"correctOption": "B",
"explanation": "Perfect competition assumes homogeneous products, meaning they are identical, so no firm can differentiate itself.",

"question": "If the cross elasticity of demand between two goods is negative, the goods are:",
"options": {
"A": "Substitutes", 
"B": "Complements", 
"C": "Independent",
"D": "Normal goods"
},
