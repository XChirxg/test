                        "A": "Astana",

                    },
                    "correctOption": "A",
                    "explanation": "The capital of Kazakhstan is Astana, renamed from Akmolinsk in 1998. Astana became the capital city due to strategic planning aimed at developing northern Kazakhstan. The decision was made after considering political, economic, and geographical factors. The city was also chosen to help balance regional development in the country. Therefore, Astana, now Nur-Sultan, serves as a critical political center.",

                    "options": {
                        "A": "Observation collapses the wave function",

                        "C": "Massless photons",

                    "correctOption": "A",
                    "explanation": "Quantum Superposition refers to a quantum system's ability to exist in multiple states at once. When observed, the system collapses into one state. This is known as the wave function collapse, a core concept in quantum mechanics. Superposition plays a key role in quantum computing, allowing quantum bits (qubits) to exist in multiple states simultaneously, offering immense computational power.",

                    "explanation": "This is an example of logical reasoning. The premise that 'some flowers fade quickly' does not necessarily apply to 'roses,' as roses are a specific subset of flowers. There is not enough information to directly conclude whether some roses fade quickly.",

                    "correctOption": "A",
                    "explanation": "Acid rain is primarily caused by sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels. These pollutants react with water vapor and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids, which then fall as acid rain. This phenomenon harms ecosystems, buildings, and the health of water bodies.",

                    "correctOption": "D",
                    "explanation": "Supervised learning involves training an AI model using labeled data, where the correct output is provided. In the case of classifying images of cats and dogs, the model is provided with labeled images (e.g., 'cat' or 'dog'), and the model learns to make predictions based on this data.",
