            <h1>Definition</h1>
            <p>Capital Market Theory is a financial theory that describes the relationship between risk and return in the capital markets. It suggests that investors can achieve a higher return by taking on higher risk and that the expected return of an investment should be commensurate with its risk.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Key Concepts of Capital Market Theory</h1>
            <p>Capital Market Theory is based on the following key concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Efficient Market Hypothesis:</b> The theory that asset prices reflect all available information and that it is impossible to consistently outperform the market.</li>
                <li><b>Risk and Return Tradeoff:</b> The principle that higher returns are associated with higher levels of risk, and that investors should be compensated for taking on additional risk.</li>
                <li><b>Capital Market Line:</b> A line representing the risk-return tradeoff for a portfolio that consists of a risk-free asset and a risky portfolio of assets.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Capital Market Line (CML)</h1>
            <p>The Capital Market Line is a graphical representation of the risk-return tradeoff for a portfolio that consists of a risk-free asset and a risky portfolio of assets. It shows the optimal combination of the risk-free asset and the risky portfolio to achieve the highest return for a given level of risk.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Security Market Line (SML)</h1>
            <p>The Security Market Line is a graphical representation of the relationship between risk and return for individual securities. It is used to determine whether a security is undervalued or overvalued based on its expected return and its risk as measured by beta.</p>
