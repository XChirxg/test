            <h1>Definition</h1>
            <p>Portfolio unique risk, also known as unsystematic risk, is the risk that is specific to an individual stock or asset and can be diversified away by holding a diversified portfolio. It includes factors such as company-specific events, management changes, and industry risks.</p>

            <h1>Measurement of Portfolio Unique Risk</h1>
            <p>Portfolio unique risk can be measured using the standard deviation of a stock's returns. A higher standard deviation indicates higher unique risk, as it reflects the volatility of the stock's returns that is not related to market movements.</p>
