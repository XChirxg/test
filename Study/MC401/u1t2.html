            <h1>Standard Deviation</h1>
            <p>Standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion or spread of a set of values. In the context of a portfolio, it measures the volatility or risk of the portfolio.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Formula for Standard Deviation</h1>
            <p>The formula to calculate standard deviation of a portfolio is:</p>
            <p>Standard Deviation = √(∑(Weight of Asset i * (Standard Deviation of Asset i)²))</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Example</h1>
            <p>Suppose you have a portfolio with two assets. Asset 1 has a weight of 0.6 and a standard deviation of 0.1, and Asset 2 has a weight of 0.4 and a standard deviation of 0.2. The standard deviation of the portfolio would be:</p>
            <p>Standard Deviation = √(0.6 * (0.1)² + 0.4 * (0.2)²) = √(0.006 + 0.016) = √0.022 ≈ 0.1483</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Types of Risk in Portfolio</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Systematic Risk:</b> Also known as market risk, it is the risk inherent to the entire market or market segment. It cannot be eliminated through diversification.</li>
                <li><b>Unsystematic Risk:</b> Also known as specific risk, it is the risk that is specific to a particular company or industry. It can be reduced through diversification.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Need for Estimating Standard Deviation</h1>
            <p>Estimating the standard deviation of a portfolio is important for investors to understand the risk associated with their investments and to make informed decisions about diversification.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Nature/Features of Standard Deviation</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Measures the volatility or risk of a portfolio.</li>
                <li>Helps in assessing the diversification benefits of adding assets to a portfolio.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Advantages of Estimating Standard Deviation</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Helps investors in managing risk by diversifying their portfolios.</li>
                <li>Provides a quantitative measure of the risk associated with a portfolio.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Disadvantages of Estimating Standard Deviation</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Does not account for all types of risk, such as political or economic risk.</li>
                <li>Relies on historical data, which may not always be indicative of future performance.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>Estimating the standard deviation of a portfolio is essential for investors to manage risk and make informed decisions about diversification, but it should be used along with other measures of risk.</p>
