            <p>Portfolio market risk, also known as systematic risk, is the risk that is inherent in the overall market and affects all investments to some degree. It cannot be diversified away and is caused by factors such as economic conditions, interest rates, and market sentiment.</p>

A beta of 1 indicates that the portfolio's returns move in line with the market, while a beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility than the market, and a beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility than the market.</p>
