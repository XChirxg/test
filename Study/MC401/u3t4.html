            <h1>Definition</h1>
            <p>Simple Sharpe's Optimization Solution is a method used to determine the optimal portfolio allocation that maximizes the Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio measures the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio and is calculated as the portfolio's excess return over the risk-free rate divided by the portfolio's standard deviation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Sharpe Ratio Formula</h1>
            <p>The Sharpe ratio is calculated as follows:</p>
            <p>\[ Sharpe Ratio = \frac{(R_p - R_f)}{\sigma_p} \]</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Where \( R_p \) is the portfolio return,</li>
                <li>\( R_f \) is the risk-free rate,</li>
                <li>\( \sigma_p \) is the portfolio standard deviation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h1>Simple Sharpe's Optimization Solution</h1>
            <p>The Simple Sharpe's Optimization Solution involves constructing a portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio by adjusting the allocation of assets in the portfolio. The optimal allocation is determined by finding the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio.</p>

            <h1>Benefits of Simple Sharpe's Optimization</h1>
            <p>Simple Sharpe's Optimization can help investors achieve better risk-adjusted returns by allocating their investments in a way that maximizes the Sharpe ratio. It can also help investors build more efficient portfolios that balance risk and return.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Limitations of Simple Sharpe's Optimization</h1>
            <p>Simple Sharpe's Optimization has some limitations, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It assumes that historical returns and volatility will continue in the future, which may not always be the case.</li>
                <li>It does not account for changes in market conditions or unexpected events that may impact the performance of the portfolio.</li>
                <li>It relies on the accuracy of inputs, such as expected returns and volatility estimates, which may be subject to error.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>Simple Sharpe's Optimization is a useful tool for investors seeking to build a portfolio that balances risk and return. By maximizing the Sharpe ratio, investors can construct portfolios that offer better risk-adjusted returns and improve their overall investment performance.</p>
