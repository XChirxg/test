            <h1>Plant Location</h1>
            <p>Plant location refers to the selection of a suitable site for establishing a manufacturing plant. It involves factors such as proximity to raw materials, access to transportation, availability of labor, and proximity to markets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Factors Influencing Plant Location</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Proximity to Raw Materials:</b> Manufacturing plants are often located near sources of raw materials to reduce transportation costs.</li>
                <li><b>Transportation Infrastructure:</b> Access to roads, railways, ports, and airports is important for transporting raw materials and finished goods.</li>
                <li><b>Availability of Labor:</b> Plants are often located in areas with a skilled and cost-effective labor force.</li>
                <li><b>Market Access:</b> Proximity to markets is important for reducing transportation costs and ensuring timely delivery to customers.</li>
                <li><b>Government Policies:</b> Government incentives, regulations, and taxes can influence plant location decisions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Plant Layout</h1>
            <p>Plant layout refers to the arrangement of machinery, equipment, and other facilities within a manufacturing plant. It aims to optimize workflow, minimize waste, and improve efficiency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Types of Plant Layout</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Process Layout:</b> Machines and equipment are grouped based on the type of process they perform. This layout is suitable for job shops or small-scale production.</li>
                <li><b>Product Layout:</b> Machines and equipment are arranged in a sequence to produce a specific product. This layout is suitable for high-volume production.</li>
                <li><b>Fixed Position Layout:</b> The product remains stationary, and workers, materials, and equipment are brought to the product. This layout is suitable for large and bulky products.</li>
                <li><b>Combination Layout:</b> A combination of process, product, and fixed position layouts to optimize different parts of the production process.</li>
            </ul>
